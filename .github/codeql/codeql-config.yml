name: "CodeQL Configuration"

# This configuration file specifies which files and directories to include or
# exclude from the CodeQL analysis.

# By default, all files in the repository are analyzed.
# We can use the 'paths' and 'paths-ignore' properties to customize this.

paths-ignore:
  - 'target/' # Ignore the Rust build output directory
  - 'iac/.terraform/' # Ignore Terraform's internal directory
  - '**/*.test.rs' # Ignore Rust test files
  - 'tests/' # Ignore the tests directory
