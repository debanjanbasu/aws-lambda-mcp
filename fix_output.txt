The workflow failure was caused by the dependabot update to `hashicorp/azuread` provider version 3.7.0, which removed the deprecated `azuread_application_password` resource. I've fixed this by migrating to the `password` block within the `azuread_application` resource, which is the correct approach for managing client secrets in the updated provider.

**Changes made:**
- Removed the separate `azuread_application_password` resource
- Added a `password` block to the `azuread_application` resource
- Updated outputs to reference `tolist(azuread_application.agentcore_app.password)[0]` for the set-based password attribute
- Added documentation comments explaining the migration

**Verification:**
- Terraform configuration validates successfully
- All tests pass
- Code passes clippy linting
- No breaking changes to functionality

The fix ensures compatibility with azuread provider 3.7.0 while maintaining the same OAuth client secret functionality. The PR workflow will now deploy successfully to the ephemeral environment for testing.
