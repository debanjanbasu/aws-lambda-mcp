The workflow failure has been fixed by replacing the deprecated `password` block in the `azuread_application` resource with a dedicated `azuread_application_password` resource. This provides more secure and reliable password management for Entra ID OAuth applications, especially in ephemeral preview environments.

Key changes made:
- Removed the deprecated `password` block from `azuread_application`
- Added a new `azuread_application_password` resource with proper lifecycle management
- Updated the `entra_client_secret` output to reference the new password resource
- Removed `password` from the `ignore_changes` lifecycle in `azuread_application`

All tests pass, code lints successfully, and the Terraform configuration is valid. The fix ensures that client secrets are created securely for each preview environment without conflicts from lifecycle ignores.
