## Issue Fixed: Terraform Apply Failure in Ephemeral Preview Environment

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The workflow failure was caused by the use of a deprecated `password` block in the `azuread_application` resource. In azuread provider v3.7.0, the `password` block was removed from `azuread_application` and replaced with a separate `azuread_application_password` resource.

**Minimal, Elegant Fix Applied:**

1. **Replaced deprecated password block** in `iac/entra_oauth.tf`:
   - Removed the `password` block from `azuread_application.agentcore_app`
   - Added a new `azuread_application_password` resource named `agentcore_app_secret`

2. **Updated output reference** in `iac/outputs.tf`:
   - Changed `tolist(azuread_application.agentcore_app.password)[0].value` to `azuread_application_password.agentcore_app_secret.value`

3. **Updated lifecycle** in `azuread_application`:
   - Removed `password` from `ignore_changes` since it no longer exists

**Validation Completed:**
- ✅ Terraform configuration validates successfully
- ✅ All tests pass (weather integration test)
- ✅ Code passes strict clippy linting (no warnings, denies unsafe code)
- ✅ Follows AGENTS.md standards (error handling, imports, naming, etc.)

**Security Improvement:**
This fix enhances security by properly separating application registration from password management, following the latest azuread provider best practices.

The ephemeral preview environment workflow should now deploy successfully without the Terraform apply failure.
